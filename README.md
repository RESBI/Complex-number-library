# What's this? 
## This is an extra mathematical operating functions library written in Haskell

# Why I wrote this? 
## 1, Practising Haskell (but I don't think this lib can trully improve my skill).
## 2, I need it.

# Who's this for? 
## It's mainly for myself, but you can report bugs. 

# How to use it?
## Just import ExtraMath. 
## If you're looking for the introductions of functions in this lib, look at the source code.

# I provided some demos.
## Another one is drawing a Mandelbrot set, it's "demo-mandelbrot.hs". 
## How to run it? 
### just "ghci demo-whichYouWantToRun.hs", and then run the "main" function.

# Todo: 
## Tons of todos here.
