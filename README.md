# What's this? 
### This is an extra mathematical operating functions library written in Haskell

# Why I wrote this? 
### 1, Practising Haskell (but I don't think this lib can trully improve my skill).
### 2, I need it.

# Who's this for? 
### It's mainly for myself, but you can report bugs. 

# How to use it?
### Put you what.hs file at this directory. 
### And then import ExtraMath.ExtraMath in your code.
### Don't forget to add "-i.\" option when you running "ghc" or "ghci -i.\ what.hs".  

# Introductions
### What are you talking about? Read the source code! 
### Thay are all in the comments, I described every functions. 

# I provided some demos.
### One is a test file, which tested complex number operating functions.
### Another one is drawing a Mandelbrot set, it's "demo-mandelbrot.hs". 
### How to run it? 
#### just "ghci -i.\ demo-mandelbrot.hs", and then run the "main" function.

# Todo: 
### Tons of todos here.
