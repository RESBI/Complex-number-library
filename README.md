# What's this? 
### ..This is a complex number library written in Haskell

# Why I wrote this? 
### 1, Practising Haskell (but I don't think this lib can trully improve my skill).
### 2, I need it.

# Who's this for? 
### It's mainly for myself, but you can report bugs. 

# How to use it?
### Just put "ComplexNumber.hs" to you project's path and then "import ComplexNumber" to use it.
### If you're looking for the introductions of functions in this lib, look at the source code.

# I provided two demos.
### One is simple calculate of complex number, it's "demo-test.hs"
### Another one is drawing a Mandelbrot set, it's "demo-mandelbrot.hs". 
### How to run it? 
#### just "ghci demo-whichYouWantToRun.hs", and then run the "main" function. 

# Todo: 
### Tons of todos here.
