# What's this? 
## This is a complex number library written for Haskell

# Who's this for? 
## It's mainly for myself, but you can report bugs. 

# How to use it?
## Just put "ComplexNumber.hs" to you project's path and then "import ComplexNumber" to use it.
## If you're looking at the introductions of functions in this lib, look at the source code.

# I provided two demos.
## One is simple calculate of complex number, it's "demo-test.hs"
## Another one is drawing a Mandelbrot set, it's "demo-mandelbrot.hs". 
## to run then, just "ghci demo-whichYouWantToRun.hs"

# Todo: 
## Tons of todos here.
